# SWM573_Document_Clustering_Summarization_and_Visualization

Explore different clustering algorithms, Implemented on the dataset

## Project Abstract & Aim

The aim of this project is to:

- Examine various clustering algorithms and apply them to the dataset.
- Group news articles into clusters.
- Suggest related articles that are similar to the ones in the dataset.
- Extract key terms from the articles and generate brief summaries.
- Utilize visualization techniques to display the relevance of the text documents.
- Detect any irregularities or outliers in the dataset.
- Identify the most frequent words in each cluster, such as through a word cloud.

## DataSet Used

Dataset used - 20 Newsgroups Dataset (http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/)

- Using sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

## Run time and Instances

To enhance the computing power and capacity for storing datasets, we used Google Colab and Pycharm Jupyter notebook.

## The methods employed for this project included various algorithms and visualization techniques.

### Clustering

- LDA
- HDBScan
- Agglomerative clustering

### Visualization Techniques

- t-SNE
- UMAP
- Compression-VAE
